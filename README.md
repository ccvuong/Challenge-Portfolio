# Challenge 📝

You won't be given any starter code therefore you'll create a web application from scratch! You'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as you progress as a developer. 

This challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: ```flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.``` You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search.
